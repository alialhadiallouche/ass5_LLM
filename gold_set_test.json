      "question": "What is the 15 puzzle and why is it important in reconfiguration problems?",
      "timestamp": "196.88 - 280.88",
      "answer": "The 15 puzzle is a 4x4 grid where one square is empty and the rest are numbered 1â€“15. You solve it by sliding tiles into the empty space to reach a goal configuration. It illustrates state space graphs and legal moves, fundamental to understanding reconfiguration problems."

    {
      "question": "What are reconfiguration graphs and how are they used in the context of the 15 puzzle?",
      "timestamp": "295.28 - 375.44",
      "answer": "Reconfiguration graphs represent each configuration as a vertex and connect configurations that differ by one legal move. This helps analyze transitions between puzzle states."

    {
      "question": "What is token sliding in the context of reconfiguration?",
      "timestamp": "844.24 - 871.20",
      "answer": "Token sliding allows tokens (representing nodes in an independent set) to move only to adjacent vertices while maintaining independence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is token jumping and how does it differ from token sliding?",
      "timestamp": "802.16 - 844.24",
      "answer": "Token jumping lets tokens move to any unoccupied vertex as long as the resulting set is still independent, unlike sliding which restricts movement to neighbors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is token sliding considered harder than token jumping?",
      "timestamp": "884.08 - 895.52",
      "answer": "Token sliding is often harder because it imposes stricter movement constraints and has been shown to be PSPACE-complete in cases where token jumping is only NP-complete."

    {
      "question": "What was the motivation for studying reconfiguration problems?",
      "timestamp": "898.56 - 971.52",
      "answer": "Motivations include modeling real-world incremental changes, understanding solution spaces, and applications in areas like quantum computing, complexity theory, and robotics."

      "question": "What open problem is mentioned regarding token jumping on bipartite graphs?",
      "timestamp": "1741.36 - 1752.64",
      "answer": "It remains open whether token jumping is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the number of tokens on bipartite graphs."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'buffer technique' mentioned in the talk?",
      "timestamp": "2549.36 - 2564.96",
      "answer": "The buffer technique refers to temporarily moving tokens to a disjoint independent set (a buffer) to facilitate rearrangement before reaching the target set."

    {
      "question": "How do token sliding and jumping behave differently on split and chordal graphs?",
      "timestamp": "1398.96 - 1410.88",
      "answer": "On split and chordal graphs, token sliding is PSPACE-complete while token jumping is solvable in polynomial time, showing the differing complexities."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between PSPACE and NP in the context of reconfiguration problems?",
      "timestamp": "1076.64 - 1168.72",
      "answer": "Many reconfiguration problems are PSPACE-complete because they may require exponential space and do not always have polynomial-size certificates, unlike typical NP problems."
